# Malicious Commit Detector

Application to detect which commit generates malicious code detection by antivirus software.

MCD use the [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com) web API to detect malicious code in files. You need a API key that you can get with a free Virus Total account.
A pro account is prefered if you have lot of files to check because the free version limit the number of request.

## Analyze your project commits

First you must create a file to explain how build the project that you will test.

The file is a TOML format et must contains this keys:

* project_dir : path of the project source code. Absolute path or relative to this file.
* build_dir : folder where the commands must be run. Relative path to project_dir.
* build_command : a list of succesive commands to run to build your project. Relative path to project_dir.
* file_path : a list of all files to analyse. Relative path to project_dir.

See example file **tests\MaliciousTest\mcd-config.toml**.

To analyze the project's master branch, run the following command:
```
.\mcd.exe detectCommit -a=XXXXXXXXXX -c=c:\Users\A\mcd\tests\mcd-config.toml -b=master
Configuration file: c:\Users\A\mcd\tests\mcd-config.toml
